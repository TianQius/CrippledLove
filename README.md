# CrippledLove
Maybe one day, you will accept my existence as I like it.  
也许有那么一天，我喜欢着的你会接受我的存在，

Maybe one day, you will wait for me instead of choosing to leave,  
也许有那么一天，你会等待着我而不是选择离开，

Maybe one day, I think of the gods and I can look directly at you,  
也许有那么一天，想你想到出神的我可以直视你，

But I understand that maybe this day will not come.   
可我明白，也许这一天并不会到来. 

I also understand that there is a huge gap between us.  
我也明白，我们之间有着巨大的隔阂.

I thought maybe it was only one in ten million possible.  
我想过，也许仅有那千万分之一的可能.

I hope, hope, repent, annoy.  
我希望着，盼望着，忏悔过，懊恼过.

It is impossible between us, just like this broken love.  
我们之间根本不可能，就犹如这残缺的爱一般。

Only my crush on you, not your love for me.  
只有我对你的暗恋，没有你对我的喜爱。

I hope this remnant will not have a full day,  
我希望这颗残爱不会有完整的一天，

I also hope to make it perfect as soon as possible.  
我也更希望可以尽快使它更加完美，

I hope that day doesn't come, and perfection always comes with setbacks.  
我希望那天不会到来，完美总是伴随着挫折。

As long as you are happy, healthy, and happy.  
只要你开心快乐，身体健康，幸福就好。

And I, just leave it to time, destined for me to wander the world, how can I be concerned  
而我，就交给时间吧，注定我要浪迹天涯，怎么能有所牵挂
